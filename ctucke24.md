I am Clayton Tucker and I am interested in all sorts of tech. I am getting pretty into audio equipment (speakers, headphones, amp and DACs, and lostless audio). I also built custom mechanical keyboards. I love being able to tweak the sounds it until it tickles my brain. I love playing video games and building computers. I am looking into setting up a home lab, I think that would be pretty cool. I would use it to run AI locally and have huge data sets to train and utilze to answer questions locally with sensitive information. I am hoping to learn some new skills that I can put to use for my home lab.
